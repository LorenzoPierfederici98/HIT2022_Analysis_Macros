# HIT2022_Analysis_Macros
This repository contains a set of macros used to analyze Calorimeter and TOF-wall data from the HIT2022 campaign, focus of my MS thesis work.
The macros can be found in the  `src/` directory. The link above takes to the documentation written with Doxygen, while clicking on the documentation badge takes to the documentation written with Sphinx.
